Landslide machine learning
This is project of my group in Hack Kosice hackathon. Our topic was to create a program which by using machine learning will predict landslide areas using high quality
and scans of terrain. There are 2 files in the repository. pakistan.csv is tabular data of area from Pakistan with scaled properties of each land cell. I used that data
to train my machine. Thats how project works now. Project is not done yet.
